Settled India favourites in yet another Sri Lanka faceoff

<p>Ahead of the series against India, Sri Lanka's earnest and articulate coach, Nic Pothas, exhorted his team not to get infatuated with India's strengths. He was asking his team to focus on what they can do, which is right, but in doing so, he might have revealed his team's state of mind ahead of the series. The last time these two teams played, not so long ago as we know, Sri Lanka didn't find itself competing and that can be a terrible feeling to recall.</p>

<p>The stats favour India, especially the fact that Sri Lanka have never won a Test match in spite of having stronger teams visit here in the past. That is both daunting and scary. But just as worrisome for Sri Lanka is that their biggest match winner, in all fairness their only genuine match winner, Rangana Herath averages 45 against India. Take away a rank turner and it would seem that that threat is largely negated. As India discovered in the series against Australia, when you play on good pitches the better side tends to win and India should expect to win this series if they play on good pitches.</p>

<p>Hardik Pandya was being eased into Test cricket well and being at a stage where every day is a point on the learning curve, it would have been good for him to notch up a few more points. But India have another all-rounder down the batting order waiting to draw attention to himself. India's excitement with Pandya is because of the belief that a batting all-rounder has been sighted. If however, India is confident of someone else batting at number six, then Bhuvneshwar Kumar down the order offers more with his bowling and the question to ask really is whether Bhuvneshwar offers more with the bat than Pandya does with the ball.</p>
<p>And it will be good to see Ashwin and Jadeja back. They will be hungry and their hunger in the past has generated a bagful of wickets. Luckily they have had a bit of cricket behind them and while the numbers haven't been outstanding, the top players tend to rise to the occasion on the big day. And with Ashwin galloping towards becoming the fastest ever to 300 wickets, there is added excitement.</p>

<p>But once all is said and done, you must ask what result those playing the matches expect. And it won't surprise me if, deep down inside, both teams believe India will win the series.</p>
